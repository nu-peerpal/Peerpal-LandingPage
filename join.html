        <h3>Our Impact</h3>
        <p class="section__description">Our impact reaches far beyond just one person or group of people. The areas and groups
            that peer grading have an impact on are more numerous than one would think.

            <h5>Students</h5>
            <p class="section__description">Students get to grade other students' work (anonymously of course!) which 
                can show them how other students work and think and give meaningful feedback to their peers. 
            </p>

            <h5>The Classroom</h5>
            <p class="section__description">There is more cohesion in the classroom as students and faculty can discuss 
                different ideas and thoughts from the peer grading assignments. 
            </p>

            <h5>Faculty and Staff</h5>
            <p class="section__description">
                Instructors can focus on teaching instead of having to allocate time to grade each student's work. The decreased 
                grading load is definitely helpful! 
            </p>

            <h5>Research</h5>
            <p class="section__description"> We can study and understand how peer grading affects learning outcomes / game theory, 
                a research topic that Professor Hartline is very interested in.

            <h3>Reinventing the grading process</h3>
            <p>By incorporating graded peer review exercises into course work, PeerPal introduces a new learning system
                with increased student engagement.</p>
            <p>We've built an end-to-end workflow for students to conduct peer reviews, receive grades, and everything
                plugs directly into Canvas!</p>
            <p>Here are some possible avenues to work on for PeerPal:
            <ul>
                <li>Migrate all services to AWS, gain experience in cloud services and scalable software solutions.</li>
                <li>Create pipelines to understand student performance in the class using extensible PeerPal data (Does
                    spending more time on your peer reviews lead to better midterm scores? What will a substantive
                    student performance dashboard look like?)</li>
                <li>Customize the PeerPal experience. Extend the platform to adhere to global interoperability
                    standards, allowing platforms beyond Canvas to use PeerPal. Plug in custom algorithms to translate
                    peer review data to final grades.</li>
