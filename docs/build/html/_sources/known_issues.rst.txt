Known Issues
============
There are a number of known problems with Canvas that cannot be fixed. Here are some common problems and
their workarounds:

Peers Cannot Edit Reviews
-------------------------
The Canvas UI does not allow peers to edit their reviews after being submitted. This restriction is 
deliberate and misguided, but Canvas is emphatic about this policy. Eventually, we will build our own 
UI for peers to enter reviews. Until then, there is an awkward workaround. If a student needs to fix an 
errant review, you can reset their review as follows:

1. From the assignment page, click “peer reviews”.  
2. Find the student whose peer review is in question.  
3. Shift click on each of their assigned peer reviews (this action opens up each submission in a new 
window).  

4. Identify the submitter of one that is to be reset (you will need to click “show rubric” on the 
right-hand side).  

5. From the peer review page, you can mouse-over the assigned peer review to reveal a button for 
deleting it.  

6. You can then reassign the exact same review (for the same submitter).

Non-submitting Students Cannot Find Review Assignment
-----------------------------------------------------
Canvas has decided that students who have not submitted should have a hard time submitting peer reviews. 
For such students, peer reviews do not appear on the assignment page where they usually appear. Instead, 
the students can find their peer reviews in the Activity Stream.

Issues with Students Dropping the Class
---------------------------------------
When students drop the class their submissions disappear in Canvas. Review assignments of these 
submissions also silently disappear. There is no current workaround for this issue.

Changes to Groups Causes Submissions to Go Missing
--------------------------------------------------
Submissions can go missing if students change groups after submission. Canvas claims that this is the 
intended behavior. Canvas recommends freezing groups after the submission deadline. If you wish to allow 
students to change groups in between assignments, you should use a new group set for each assignment. If 
most students are to remain in their original groups, an effective way to do this is by clone the group 
set after each assignment and using the cloned group set for the next assignment.
