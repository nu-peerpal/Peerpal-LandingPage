Manual Review Grading
===========

It is recommended to use manual review grading. The advantage of manual review grading is that the
grader can accurately grade the textual feedback in the reviews. In typical use cases, the most timely part
of grading is reviewing the submission. Once a submission is reviewed by the grader, the grader can quickly
and easily enter review grades on each of the reviews. See the discussion of this in :ref:`Grader Interface<grader_interface>`.

To enable manual review grading, simply add a rubric to the peer review assignment in Canvas. The
recommended procedure for doing so is the following.

- For the first assignment: Enable it for peer review selecting an appropriate number of points. This creates the peer review assignment (a place holder for the peer review grades, and with instructions for students for conducting peer reviews). Open the newly created assignment in Canvas and click the “add rubric” button. Add your desired rubric. It is recommended that your rubric have elements for what you want your peer reviewers to be doing. Typical elements might include: quality of suggestions or discussion, quality of written assessment (according to the rubric), quality of numeric assessment (according to the rubric).
- For subsequent assignments: enable the assignment for peer review selecting the peer review rubric (by name) instead of selecting the number of points for the review.

When you enable manual reviews, the process of running the grading algorithms is slightly different.
Specifically, you will still have a chance to change review grades at the time in the process when the review
grading algorithm is run. This algorithm still runs because it is needed to create summary feedback for the
reviewers. Thus summary feedback for the peer includes **(a)** their peer review of the submission, **(b)** the
grader's review of the submission, and **(c)** the grader's review of peer's review. There review grade, in this
step, however is not from an algorithm it is the manual grade given by the grader. On this page, you have
the option to both save the review grades and save the review reports. You must save the review reports.
Saving the review grades is unnecessary because no changes have been made.
