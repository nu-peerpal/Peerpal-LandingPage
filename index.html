            <h3>Reinventing the grading process</h3>
            <p>By incorporating graded peer review exercises into course work, PeerPal introduces a new learning system with increased student engagement.</p>
            <p>We've built an end-to-end workflow for students to conduct peer reviews, receive grades, and everything plugs directly into Canvas!</p>
            <p>Here are some possible avenues to work on for PeerPal:
                <ul>
                    <li>Migrate all services to AWS, gain experience in cloud services and scalable software solutions.</li>
                    <li>Create pipelines to understand student performance in the class using extensible PeerPal data (Does spending more time on your peer reviews lead to better midterm scores? What will a substantive student performance dashboard look like?)</li>
                    <li>Customize the PeerPal experience. Extend the platform to adhere to global interoperability standards, allowing platforms beyond Canvas to use PeerPal. Plug in custom algorithms to translate peer review data to final grades.</li>
                </ul>
