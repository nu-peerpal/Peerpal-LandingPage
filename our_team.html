        <h3>Who Are We?</h3>
        <p class="section__description">We are a team of open-minded and inquisitive students who are passionate 
            about technology and education working on a peer grading platform project headed by Professor Jason 
            Hartline at Northwestern University. Our developers are all students at Northwestern who strive 
            to achieve their best on this project while also gaining in-depth knowledge of web development.   </p>

            <h5>Design Concept</h5>
            <p class="section__description">Approaching peer-grading with an understanding of human-centered design
                allows us to get creative with how we imagine the peer-grading experience.</p>

            <h5>Development experience</h5>
            <p class="section__description">Students get to take ownership of the project and work on the features
                that are most interesting to them. Learn by doing, and watch your work be used in real classrooms.

                iteratively, craft user stories, assign story points, and develop efficiently with our Agile
